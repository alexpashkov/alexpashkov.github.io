      <h1>Alex's Pashkov Teach Yourself Computer Science Daily Blog</h1>
      <p>
        I am committing to a daily routine going through subjects and materials
        from
        <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">teachyourselfcs.com</a>. The
        subjects are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Programming</li>
        <li>Computer Architecture</li>
        <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
        <li>Math for CS</li>
        <li>Operating Systems</li>
        <li>Computer Networking</li>
        <li>Databases</li>
        <li>Languages and Compilers</li>
        <li>Distributed Systems</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Given there are nine of them, an expectation to spend 100-200 hours on
        each and that I'm studying up to an hour daily, it should take up to 5
        years to finish. That is a long-term investment that is supposed to help
        me excel in the profession. Let's see how long I last.
      </p>

        Below you can see short daily notes on what I've learned. You can find
        commit history

        to make sure I am not cheating.
