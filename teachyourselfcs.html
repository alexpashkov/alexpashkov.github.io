      <p>
        I am committing to a daily routine going through subjects and materials
        from
        <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">teachyourselfcs.com</a>. The
        subjects are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Programming</li>
        <li>Computer Architecture</li>
        <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
        <li>Math for CS</li>
        <li>Operating Systems</li>
        <li>Computer Networking</li>
        <li>Databases</li>
        <li>Languages and Compilers</li>
        <li>Distributed Systems</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Given there are nine of them, an expectation to spend 100-200 hours on
        each and that I'm studying up to an hour daily, it should take up to 5
        years to finish. That is a long-term investment that is supposed to help
        me excel in the profession. Let's see how long I last.
      </p>

        Below you can see short daily notes on what I've learned. You can find
        commit history

        to make sure I am not cheating.

              Processors work with strings of bytes that represent machine level
              instructions. It's important to understand machine level
              representations of code since some situations like improving
              performance in the critical sections of the program may require
              peeking into actual machine-level code generated. Understanding
              the code working with it, e.g doing the exercises from the book.

              Instruction set (also referred as Instruction Set Architecture or
              ISA) is an abstract model of a computer, a realization ISA, such
              as CPU is an implementation
              <sup><a href="#instruction_set">1</a></sup
              >. The most common architecture nowadays is Intel's x86-64 which
              has 64 bit address space and allows enormous amounts of memory (up
              to 2 <sup>64</sup>), as opposed to 32 bit ISA's that allow only
              around 4GB.
