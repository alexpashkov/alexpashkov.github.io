      <h1>Alex's Pashkov Teach Yourself CS Daily Blog</h1>
      <p>
        I am committing to performing daily routine studying materials listed at
        <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">teachyourselfcs.com</a>. Given
        that I spend up to one hour every day and 9 subjects with a suggestion
        to spend 100-200 hours on each of them it should take up to 5 years to
        finish. That is a long-term investment that is supposed to help me excel
        at the profession. Let's see how long I last.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below you can see short daily notes on what I've learned. You can find
        commit history
        <a href="https://github.com/alexpashkov/teachyourselfcs">here</a> to
        make sure I am not cheating.
